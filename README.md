# Simple-Shell



 This is a C program to act like a small shell that processes single commands entered by the user. In particular, the program assembles the command and execute it by using the strtok() and fork(). The commands/programs location can be anywhere in $PATH and might have arguments.
 
E.g., if the input-line entered by the user is

  ls -F
